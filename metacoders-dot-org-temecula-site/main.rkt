      ;#:description   "In our Winter program, students at La Jolla will learn how to code their own whack-a-mole style games that utilize the mouse. Students will learn how to customize their game with near endless possible combinations: Are you a UFO collecting cows? Or a kid eating up their favorite foods and avoiding their least favorites? Or a ninja nabbing fruit and not the bombs? Their games will feature a point system, and students will code in-game items such that they gain or lose points when the player clicks on them. This course will not only strengthen studentsâ€™ coding skills, but also their keyboard and mouse skills. Throughout the course, students will earn physical badges that demonstrate their mastery and inspire them to keep coding!"
